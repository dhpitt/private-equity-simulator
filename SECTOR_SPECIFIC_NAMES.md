# Sector-Specific Company Names

## Overview

All companies, regardless of size, now have a chance of having names that indicate their sector. This makes it easier to identify what industry a company operates in just from its name.

## The Change

### Before
- **Local-style names** (e.g., "Tony's Liquor Store"): 100% sector-specific
- **Corporate-style names** (e.g., "Global Industries Inc"): 0% sector-specific (completely generic)

**Problem**: Large companies (>$5M revenue) had 80% chance of corporate names, meaning 80% of large companies had completely generic names that didn't hint at their sector.

### After
- **Local-style names**: Still 100% sector-specific
- **Corporate-style names**: Now 50% sector-specific

## Technical Details

### Implementation

**File:** `simulation/procedural_gen.py`

**New Function:** `generate_corporate_name(sector: str)`
```python
def generate_corporate_name(sector: str = None) -> str:
    # 50% chance to use sector-specific components
    use_sector = sector and random.random() < 0.5
    
    if use_sector:
        # Use sector-specific prefixes, roots, suffixes
        components = sector_components.get(sector)
        # ... generate name
    else:
        # Use generic corporate components
        # ... generate name
```

**Modified Function:** `generate_company_name()`
```python
def generate_company_name(sector: str = None, style: str = 'corporate') -> str:
    if style == 'local':
        return generate_local_business_name(sector)
    else:
        return generate_corporate_name(sector)  # Now sector-aware!
```

### Configuration

No configuration changes needed. The system automatically:
1. Passes sector to name generation
2. Randomly selects between sector-specific and generic
3. Works for all company sizes

## Conclusion

All companies now have sector-appropriate names, making the game more immersive and easier to play. Large companies went from **20% sector identification** to **60% sector identification** - a **3x improvement!** 🎯

The change maintains variety (not all names are sector-specific) while ensuring players can usually identify what industry a company operates in just from its name.
