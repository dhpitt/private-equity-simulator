## Quick Tutorial

### First Steps
1. Start the game and press Enter at the intro screen
2. Choose option 2 "View Market Conditions" to understand the economic environment
3. Choose option 3 "Acquire Company" to see available deals

### Making Your First Acquisition
1. Review the list of available companies
2. Select one to view detailed financials
3. Negotiate the purchase price:
   - Option 1: Accept the asking price (faster but expensive)
   - Option 2: Make a counter-offer (try 10-20% below asking)
   - Option 3: Walk away if it's not a good deal

### Operating Your Portfolio
1. After acquiring companies, use option 4 "Operate Portfolio Companies"
2. Try different operations:
   - **Cost Cutting**: Improves margins but may hurt growth
   - **Capex Investment**: Boosts growth but costs cash
   - **Replace Management**: Get better management teams
   - **Growth Strategy**: Pursue acquisitions, expansion, or diversification

### Advancing Time
- Choose option 6 "Advance to Next Quarter" to progress
- Each quarter:
  - Your companies will perform based on their characteristics
  - Market conditions will change
  - Random events may occur
  - You'll pay interest on any debt

### Exiting Investments
- Use option 5 "Exit Investment" when you want to sell
- Try to exit when:
  - Valuations are high (market boom)
  - You've improved the company significantly
  - You need cash for better opportunities

## Tips for Your First Game

1. **Start Small**: Buy 1-2 companies first to learn the mechanics
2. **Diversify Sectors**: Don't put everything in one industry
3. **Watch Your Cash**: Keep some reserves for opportunities
4. **Use Debt Wisely**: Leverage amplifies returns but costs quarterly interest
5. **Be Active**: Don't just buy and hold - improve your companies!

## Understanding the Numbers

- **EBITDA Margin**: Higher is better (15-35% is typical)
- **Growth Rate**: Quarterly growth (2-5% per quarter is good)
- **Valuation Multiples**: 
  - Technology: ~12x EBITDA
  - Healthcare: ~11x EBITDA
  - Industrial: ~8.5x EBITDA
  - Retail: ~7x EBITDA

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Overpaying for acquisitions
2. Running out of cash
3. Taking on too much debt
4. Ignoring market conditions
5. Not operating on portfolio companies
6. Holding companies too long without exiting
