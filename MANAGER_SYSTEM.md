# Manager System

## Overview

The Manager System brings management teams to life with:
1. **Visible Impact**: Quarterly narratives showing how manager attributes affect performance
2. **Strategic Hiring**: Choose between multiple candidates with different strengths and tradeoffs
3. **Narrative Events**: Detailed stories for hiring and firing managers

## Manager Attributes

Every manager has three core attributes (0-100%):

### 1. Competence (📊)
- **High (75%+)**: Consistently outperforms, captures opportunities, drives growth
- **Medium (50-75%)**: Solid execution, maintains steady operations
- **Low (<50%)**: Poor decisions, missed opportunities, underperformance

**Impact**: Directly affects quarterly growth (+/-5%)

### 2. Risk Profile (🎲)
- **High (70%+)**: Bold, aggressive strategies - can deliver outsized returns OR blow up
- **Medium (40-70%)**: Balanced approach, moderate risk-taking
- **Low (<40%)**: Conservative, steady, predictable

**Impact**: Adds performance variance (+/-5% noise)

### 3. Cooperativeness (🤝)
- **High (75%+)**: Easy to work with, implements your directives smoothly
- **Medium (50-75%)**: Reasonable to manage, occasional friction
- **Low (<50%)**: Stubborn, difficult, resists your strategic vision

**Impact**: Affects termination difficulty, transition periods, and occasional performance drag

## Quarterly Performance Narratives

Managers now provide visible feedback each quarter based on their performance:

### High Competence + Positive Performance
```
"Rebecca Smith executed brilliantly this quarter, capturing market opportunities."
"Under David Chen's leadership, the company significantly outperformed."
```

### Low Competence + Negative Performance
```
"Braylyn Gupta made several poor strategic decisions that hurt performance."
"The company underperformed due to Jensen Williams's inadequate leadership."
```

### High Risk Success
```
"Noah Martinez's bold risks paid off spectacularly!"
"Aggressive moves by Sariah Patel delivered outsized returns."
```

### High Risk Failure
```
"Hunter Davis's risky bets backfired badly."
"Aggressive strategies by Skylynn Brown blew up in spectacular fashion."
```

### Low Cooperativeness Issues
```
"Mckynlee Johnson resisted implementing your strategic directives."
"Friction with Isaac Wang slowed execution of key initiatives."
```

## Manager Replacement

### The Old Way (Simple)
- Pay $500K
- Get random manager
- Hope they're better

### The New Way (Strategic)

#### 1. Candidate Selection Screen

When replacing a manager, you see **3 candidates** with different archetypes:

```
SELECT NEW MANAGER:
======================================================================

1. The Operator - Sarah Chen
   Steady hand, proven track record, no drama. (Competence +36%, Cooperativeness +43%)
   Stats: Competence 71% | Risk 24% | Coop 73%

2. The Turnaround Artist - Marcus Thompson
   Will cut hard and move fast. Not gentle. (Competence +44%, Cooperativeness +20%)
   Stats: Competence 79% | Risk 76% | Coop 50%

3. The Star - Jennifer Park
   Best in class, knows it, won't listen to you. (Competence +58%)
   Stats: Competence 93% | Risk 65% | Coop 25%

4. Cancel
```

#### 2. Manager Archetypes

**The Yes-Person** 🙋

### 3. Firing Narrative

After selecting a candidate, you see how the termination goes:

**Cooperative Manager:**
```
💼 TERMINATION
======================================================================

Rebecca Chen handled her departure professionally, facilitating a smooth transition.

Losing Rebecca Chen's expertise will be felt for several quarters.
```

**Uncooperative Manager:**
```
💼 TERMINATION
======================================================================

Braylyn Gupta fought the decision, threatening litigation and demanding a larger severance.

Employees are relieved to see Braylyn Gupta go - morale immediately improved.
```

### 4. Hiring Narrative

Then you see how the new hire is received:

**High Competence:**
```
🤝 NEW HIRE
======================================================================

Sarah Chen comes with an impressive track record and immediately commands respect.
```

**Low Cooperativeness:**
```
🤝 NEW HIRE
======================================================================

Marcus Thompson made it clear he'll run things his way.
```

**High Risk:**
```
🤝 NEW HIRE
======================================================================

Expect volatility - Jennifer Park doesn't shy away from big bets.
```

### 5. Transition Impact

Finally, you see the concrete effects:

```
TRANSITION IMPACT
======================================================================

  Growth Penalty:       -2.1% (temporary)
  Volatility Change:     +1.8%
  Health Impact:         +8.5%
  Cost:                  $500,000

💳 Financed with $350,000 debt
```

## Strategic Implications

### When to Replace Management

**Strong Reasons:**
- Competence < 50% (poor performer)
- Low cooperativeness causing friction (< 40%)
- Company underperforming consistently
- Need specific skillset (e.g., turnaround artist for struggling company)

**Weak Reasons:**
- Marginal competence improvement (60% → 65% not worth it)
- One bad quarter (variance happens)
- Just hired recently (transition costs add up)

### Choosing the Right Candidate

**For a Healthy, Growing Company:**
→ **The Operator** (steady execution)

**For a Struggling Company:**
→ **The Turnaround Artist** (aggressive fixes)

**For Maximum Growth Potential:**
→ **The Visionary** (high risk, high reward)

**For Maximum Performance:**
→ **The Star** (but prepare for conflict)

**For Maximum Control:**
→ **The Yes-Person** (but limited upside)

**For Low Drama:**
→ **The Safe Choice** (solid B+ performer)

### Tradeoffs Are Real

You **cannot** get a manager with:
- 95% competence + 95% cooperativeness + low risk
- High competence + high cooperativeness = lower risk tolerance
- Very high competence + very high cooperativeness = rare and expensive

**Every candidate has tradeoffs:**
- The Star won't listen to you
- The Yes-Person isn't very competent
- The Visionary might blow up
- The Turnaround Artist is aggressive (not gentle)

### Transition Costs

**Every manager replacement incurs:**

1. **Direct Cost**: $500K
2. **Transition Penalty**: -1% to -3% growth (temporary)
3. **Volatility Change**: Based on risk profile difference
4. **Potential Additional Costs**: If old manager was uncooperative
5. **Reputation Hit**: If termination is difficult

**This means:**
- Don't churn managers every quarter
- Make sure the upgrade is worth it
- Time replacements strategically (not right before exit)

## Manager Performance Visibility

### During Quarterly Advance

After each quarter, you'll see "MANAGEMENT REPORTS" highlighting notable manager performance:

```
======================================================================
MANAGEMENT REPORTS
======================================================================

📊 TechCo:
   David Chen executed brilliantly this quarter, capturing market opportunities.

📊 HealthCo:
   Braylyn Smith's risky bets backfired badly.

📊 RetailCo:
   Rebecca Johnson resisted implementing your strategic directives.
```

**This helps you:**
- Identify managers who are hurting performance
- See when high-risk strategies pay off (or don't)
- Spot cooperativeness issues early

### Not Every Quarter

Narratives only appear when manager impact is **noteworthy**:
- Very positive performance (competence + good results)
- Very negative performance (low competence)
- High-risk success or failure
- Cooperativeness friction

**Absence of narrative = normal performance**

```

## Testing Results

```
✓ Candidates generated with tradeoffs
