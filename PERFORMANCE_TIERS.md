# Performance Tier System

## Overview

The game's final scoring is based on **absolute net worth**, not return multiples. This makes the game significantly more challenging and rewards players who can scale their operations to build real wealth.

## Grading Scale

| Grade | Net Worth Range | Description | What It Takes |
|-------|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| **S** | $10B+ | LEGENDARY PE TITAN | 5,000x returns - Build an empire through massive roll-ups and perfect execution |
| **A** | $1B - $10B | PE SUPERSTAR | 500-5,000x returns - Enter the billionaire's club |
| **B** | $500M - $1B | Excellent Performance | 250-500x returns - Serious wealth creation |
| **C** | $200M - $500M | Solid Performance | 100-250x returns - Making real money |
| **D** | $100M - $200M | Mediocre Performance | 50-100x returns - Didn't scale big |
| **E** | $10M - $100M | Poor Performance | 5-50x returns - Barely grew from start |
| **F** | < $10M | LOSS | <5x returns - Lost money |

## Starting Context

- **Starting Capital**: $2,000,000
- **Game Duration**: 20 quarters (5 years)

## What This Means

### Old System (Return Multiple Based)
- S-tier: 3.0x returns = $6M final net worth
- Easy to achieve with 2-3 good deals
- Focused on percentage returns

### New System (Absolute Wealth Based)
- S-tier: $10B final net worth = 5,000x returns!
- Requires massive scaling and aggressive growth
- Focused on building actual wealth, not just multiples

## Strategic Implications

### To Reach Each Tier

**S-Tier ($10B+):**
- Requires 15-20+ successful acquisitions
- Extensive use of roll-up strategies
- Perfect timing on market cycles
- Aggressive leverage with high reputation
- Near-perfect operational execution
- Likely requires 5+ major roll-ups at increasing scales

**A-Tier ($1B+):**
- 10-15 successful acquisitions
- Multiple roll-ups or aggressive growth strategies
- Strong operational improvements across portfolio
- Good market timing
- High reputation enabling large debt capacity

**B-Tier ($500M+):**
- 7-10 successful acquisitions
- Some roll-ups or growth strategies
- Solid operational execution
- Decent leverage and timing

**C-Tier ($200M+):**
- 5-7 successful acquisitions
- Good operational improvements
- Some strategic growth
- The "solid performance" baseline

**D-Tier ($100M+):**
- 3-5 acquisitions
- Basic operational improvements
- Limited scaling
- "Mediocre" - you made money but didn't build serious wealth

**E-Tier ($10M+):**
- 1-3 acquisitions
- Poor execution or bad timing
- Barely better than doing nothing

**F-Tier (<$10M):**
- Lost money
- Bad deals, poor operations, or market crashes

## Why This Change?

The old system rewarded small-scale success too generously. A player could get an S-tier grade with just $6M by tripling their money on a couple deals.

The new system reflects **real private equity dynamics**:
- Scale matters
- You need to deploy capital efficiently
- Building a $10B fund from $2M requires exceptional performance
- The game now requires aggressive growth strategies (especially roll-ups)
- More realistic pressure to scale operations

## Difficulty Increase

| Metric | Old System | New System | Increase |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| S-tier requirement | $6M (3.0x) | $10B (5,000x) | 1,666x harder |
| A-tier requirement | $5M (2.5x) | $1B (500x) | 200x harder |
| B-tier requirement | $4M (2.0x) | $500M (250x) | 125x harder |

## Examples

**Scenario 1: Conservative Play**
- 5 acquisitions, good operations, limited growth
- Final net worth: $150M
- **Grade: D (Mediocre)** - Made money but didn't scale

**Scenario 2: Aggressive Growth**
- 12 acquisitions, 3 roll-ups, good timing
- Final net worth: $750M
- **Grade: B (Excellent)** - Built serious wealth

**Scenario 3: PE Master**
- 20 acquisitions, 6 major roll-ups, perfect execution
- Final net worth: $8B
- **Grade: A (Superstar)** - Near-legendary performance

**Scenario 4: Legendary Run**
- 25+ acquisitions, 8+ roll-ups at massive scale
- Final net worth: $15B
- **Grade: S (Legendary)** - Built an empire

## Roll-Up Strategy Importance

With the new tier system, **roll-up strategies become essential** for reaching A and S tiers:

- Roll-ups multiply revenue by 10-20%
- Each roll-up costs ~$3-4M for a $2M revenue company
- To build $10B, you need to execute multiple roll-ups at increasing scales
- Late-game roll-ups might cost $100M+ but add $500M+ to portfolio value

**Example Path to S-Tier:**
1. Quarters 1-5: Build to $50M (bootstrap with small acquisitions)
2. Quarters 6-10: First major roll-up → $200M (C-tier checkpoint)
3. Quarters 11-15: Second major roll-up → $1B (A-tier checkpoint)
4. Quarters 16-20: Third massive roll-up → $10B+ (S-tier!)

## Commentary by Tier

| Grade | Commentary |
|-------|-----------|
| S | 🏆 LEGENDARY! You've built an empire. The PE world bows before you. |
| A | ⭐ SUPERSTAR! You're in the billionaire's club. Institutional LPs are calling. |
| B | 💰 Excellent! You've built serious wealth. Your fund is crushing it. |
| C | ✓ Solid work. You're making real money. Keep scaling. |
| D | 📊 Mediocre performance. You made some money, but didn't scale big. |
| E | 😬 Poor performance. Barely grew from starting capital. |
| F | 💸 You lost money. Time to find a new career. |

## Tips for High Scores

1. **Scale Aggressively**: Don't be content with 3-5 companies
2. **Use Roll-Ups**: Essential for reaching A/S tiers
3. **Leverage Your Reputation**: High reputation = more debt = bigger deals
4. **Reinvest Profits**: Every dollar of profit should fund the next acquisition
5. **Time the Market**: Buy in recessions, sell in booms to maximize capital
6. **Operational Excellence**: Every company should be improved before exit
7. **Think Exponentially**: $2M → $10B requires exponential, not linear, growth

## Conclusion

The new tier system transforms the game from "achieve decent multiples" to "build an actual PE empire." S-tier is now truly legendary and requires mastery of all game mechanics, especially aggressive scaling through roll-ups and strategic acquisitions.

**The real challenge isn't making money - it's making BILLIONS.** 🚀
